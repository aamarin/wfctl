# Research index

External sources an argument may cite. **Nothing here binds anything.**

`knowledge-placement` routes a constraint on the system to `docs/architecture/`
and guidance for the worker to `AGENTS.md`. This is neither: it is material a
design pass is expected to *argue against*, and a source that cannot be argued
with has been promoted to a constraint by accident.

Placed outside the arch root on purpose. A subdirectory under
`docs/architecture/` is counted by the level-2 design gate as if it held records
(#171), so a branch that only edited research would satisfy a gate about
boundaries.

Each entry names the source, the claim taken from it, and **what would refute
the claim in this codebase**. An entry with no refutation condition is not
research; it is a belief with a citation.

## Abstraction and module boundaries

Added 2026-09-05, while deciding how the five `proposed` records from #149
should express the boundaries they draw. Raised by the observation that every
boundary in wfctl is a naming convention Python does not check.

| Source | Claim taken | What would refute it here |
|---|---|---|
| [Published Interface](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PublishedInterface.html) | *"The distinction between published and public is actually more important than that between public and private."* An interface is published when it is used outside the codebase that defines it — the problem case is only when *"you can't reach the calling code."* | A consumer importing `wfctl.*` from outside the wheel. Today: none. `grep "from wfctl"` outside `wfctl/` and `tests/` returns nothing |
| [Yagni](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) | *"Yagni only applies to capabilities built into the software to support a presumptive feature, it does not apply to effort to make the software easier to modify."* And: *"if you do something for a future need that doesn't actually increase the complexity of the software, there's no reason to invoke yagni."* | A boundary expression that does add complexity for current readers — an interface hierarchy, a plugin registry, a second vocabulary to keep in sync |
| [Yagni](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) | *"Any abstraction that makes it harder to understand the code for current requirements is presumed guilty."* | Nothing. This is `architecture-design`'s own "never invent an abstraction as a third outcome", from a second direction |
| Rule of Three (Fowler, *Refactoring*) | The third usage justifies the abstraction; the first is a concrete implementation and the second is a copy | A second tracker backend shipping. Today `wfctl/agents/trackers/` holds one file: `github.json` |
| Parnas, via [Fowler's architecture guide](https://martinfowler.com/architecture/) | A module is *"characterized by knowledge of a design decision"*, and the target is *"the elimination of inter-module relations towards those decisions"* | A module whose hidden decision cannot be named. `_io`'s is "how bytes reach disk without a torn write" — which is why `events.jsonl` living there is a finding |

### What the set argues, taken together

wfctl has exactly one published interface and it is not in Python. The CLI
surface — `wfctl status --json` in particular, parsed by `speckit-orchestrate`
and `start-session`, which run inside repos wfctl cannot reach — is published in
Fowler's sense. `pipeline-state-is-one-payload` already governs it.

Every Python name in the package is public-but-not-published. So a module
boundary here does not need to be *stable*; it needs to be *legible*. That is a
weaker requirement than `the-underscore-is-the-module-contract` argues from, and
it admits cheaper answers.

### The strongest argument against

Fowler's published/public distinction is about **refactoring cost**, and the
underscore record's real value may not be refactoring cost at all — it is
telling the next reader which names are load-bearing. If comprehension rather
than breakage is the driver, the record's boundary survives untouched and only
its expression is in question, which is what #149's amendment already concluded.

Whoever runs the level-2 pass must answer this rather than cite the row above.

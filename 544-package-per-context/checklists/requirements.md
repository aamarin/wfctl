# Specification Quality Checklist: package-per-context

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The users of this feature are developers changing wfctl's own code, so the
  spec names files, imports, and commands. Those are the surface the developer
  sees, not implementation choices. The check's internals, such as how it
  parses the map or the baseline's exact syntax, are left to the plan.
- SC-003 names a time budget for the check because it runs inside `wfctl
  verify` on every change.
